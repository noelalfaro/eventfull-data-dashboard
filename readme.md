# Web Development Project 6 - Seatfull Data Dashboard

This is a web app built using React.js and uses the Seatgeek API to showcase popular events across the United States.
The user can search through events by their different performers and click any specific event to view more information about it such as the prices.
The Recharts JS library helps chart the lowest prices of the top 20 most popular events.
The site also uses react-router-dom to accomplish the navigation.
